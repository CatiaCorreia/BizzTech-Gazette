<p>Hello! My name is Cátia and I’m a computer science student.</p>

<p>I created this blog to have a place where I could centralize two of my interests, <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>business</strong>.</p>

<p>The purpose of this blog is to daily aggregate interesting articles of these two vast areas.</p>
